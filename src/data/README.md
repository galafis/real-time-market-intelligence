# Data Module

## Overview

The `data` module is responsible for data ingestion, processing, and management within the Real-Time Market Intelligence Platform. This module handles the collection of financial data from multiple sources and prepares it for streaming and analysis.

## Structure

This module will contain:

- **Connectors**: Interfaces to connect with various financial data APIs (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, etc.)
- **Processors**: Data transformation and normalization pipelines
- **Validators**: Data quality checks and validation logic
- **Storage**: Data persistence layer interfaces

## Key Responsibilities

### Data Ingestion
- Connect to external financial APIs
- Fetch real-time market data (prices, volumes, indicators)
- Retrieve news feeds and social media data
- Handle rate limiting and API quotas

### Data Processing
- Normalize data from different sources into unified formats
- Clean and validate incoming data
- Enrich data with additional metadata
- Transform raw data for downstream consumption

### Data Quality
- Validate data completeness and accuracy
- Handle missing or corrupted data
- Implement retry logic for failed requests
- Monitor data freshness and latency

## Integration Points

- **Kafka**: Publishes processed data to Kafka topics for real-time streaming
- **ClickHouse**: Stores historical data for analytical queries
- **Redis**: Caches frequently accessed data for performance
- **API Module**: Provides data access endpoints for external consumption

## Configuration

Data sources and processing parameters are configured through:
- Environment variables (defined in `.env`)
- Configuration files (managed by `src/config/`)
- API credentials and connection strings

## Development Status

This module is currently under active development as part of Phase 2 of the project roadmap.

## Usage Example

```python
from src.data.connectors import AlphaVantageConnector
from src.data.processors import DataNormalizer

# Initialize connector
connector = AlphaVantageConnector(api_key="your_key")

# Fetch data
raw_data = connector.fetch_stock_price("AAPL")

# Process and normalize
normalizer = DataNormalizer()
processed_data = normalizer.normalize(raw_data)
```

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional data sources (cryptocurrency exchanges, commodities)
- Advanced data preprocessing with machine learning
- Real-time anomaly detection in incoming data
- Data versioning and lineage tracking
