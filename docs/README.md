# Documentation

## Overview

The docs directory serves as the central documentation hub for the Real-Time Market Intelligence Platform. This directory contains comprehensive technical documentation, architecture diagrams, API references, deployment guides, and user documentation to support developers, operators, and end users.

## Purpose

This documentation system provides:

- **Technical Documentation**: Architecture, design decisions, and implementation details
- **API References**: Complete endpoint documentation with examples
- **Deployment Guides**: Instructions for various deployment scenarios
- **User Guides**: End-user documentation and tutorials
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Visual representations of system components and data flows
- **Development Guidelines**: Standards and best practices for contributors

## Documentation Standards

### Format

- All documentation is written in Markdown format
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where applicable
- Keep sections focused and well-organized
- Use diagrams to illustrate complex concepts

### Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens for file names: `my-document.md`
- Use descriptive names that reflect content
- Group related documents in subdirectories

### Structure

Each documentation file should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Title

## Overview
Brief overview of the topic

## Prerequisites
What users need to know or have before proceeding

## Main Content
Detailed documentation sections

## Examples
Practical examples and code snippets

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions

## References
Links to related documentation and external resources
```

## Architecture Documentation

### Creating Architecture Diagrams

We use PlantUML and Mermaid for creating architecture diagrams:

**PlantUML Example:**
```plantuml
@startuml
title System Architecture

component "API Gateway" as api
component "Kafka" as kafka
component "ClickHouse" as db

api --> kafka : events
kafka --> db : store
@enduml
```

**Mermaid Example:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Data Sources] --> B[Ingestion Service]
    B --> C[Kafka Cluster]
    C --> D[Stream Processor]
    D --> E[ClickHouse]
    D --> F[API Gateway]
    F --> G[Dashboard]
```

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

All significant architectural decisions should be documented using ADRs:

1. Copy the ADR template from `templates/adr-template.md`
2. Number it sequentially (e.g., `adr-001-kafka-as-message-broker.md`)
3. Document the context, decision, and consequences
4. Place in `architecture/decisions/` directory

## API Documentation

### REST API Documentation Format

Each API endpoint should be documented with:

```markdown
### GET /api/v1/market/{symbol}

Retrieve real-time market data for a specific symbol.

**Parameters:**
- `symbol` (string, required): Asset symbol (e.g., "AAPL")
- `interval` (string, optional): Data interval ("1m", "5m", "1h", "1d")

**Request Example:**
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/market/AAPL?interval=5m" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "price": 150.25,
  "volume": 1000000,
  "timestamp": "2025-09-29T22:54:00Z",
  "change_percent": 2.5
}
```

**Error Codes:**
- `400`: Invalid parameters
- `401`: Unauthorized
- `404`: Symbol not found
- `429`: Rate limit exceeded
```

## Deployment Documentation

### Deployment Guide Template

Each deployment guide should include:

1. **Prerequisites**: System requirements, accounts, credentials
2. **Environment Setup**: Configuration and preparation steps
3. **Deployment Steps**: Detailed step-by-step instructions
4. **Verification**: How to verify successful deployment
5. **Monitoring**: Monitoring and logging setup
6. **Troubleshooting**: Common deployment issues
7. **Rollback**: How to rollback if needed

## User Documentation
